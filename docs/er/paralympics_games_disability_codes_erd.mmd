    %% GAME: rows from 'games' sheet (use surrogate game_id as PK)
    GAME {
        game_id string PK
        type string
        year int
        country string

    %% DISABILITY: catalogue of disability categories (derived from splitting games.disabilities_included)
    DISABILITY {
        disability_id string PK
        name string
    }

    %% GAME_DISABILITY: many-to-many between GAME and DISABILITY (one game may include multiple disabilities)
    GAME_DISABILITY {
        game_id string FK
        disability_id string FK

        region string
        subregion string
        member_type string

    %% Relationships
    GAME ||--o{ GAME_DISABILITY : has
    DISABILITY ||--o{ GAME_DISABILITY : "used_in"

    %% Optional mapping: a GAME may be associated with a TEAM_CODE (e.g., host country code) if you map GAME.country -> TEAM_CODE.team_name
    TEAM_CODE ||--o{ GAME : "may_host"
```
